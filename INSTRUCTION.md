A React-Redux focused take home test for Front-end Developers.

## Instructions

- You are to keep this document and assignment details private and work on it independently.
- If you require any clarifications, please email don_lee@tech.gov.sg/ philip_tran@tech.gov.sg with your questions.
- Upon completion of the assignment (can be any time before the deadline), please inform us by email to don_lee@tech.gov.sg/ philip_tran@tech.gov.sg. We will then send you a meeting link to share with us your work and design thoughts.
- Complete this exercise and submit either a zip of the solution or a link to a private repo
- Please use React, Redux frameworks in your solution. All other choices of libraries, frameworks, etc. are up to you.

## Requirements

- Solution should be responsive
- Use the included `weather.json` file as your datasource (sample data from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?id=1880251&units=metric&appid=439d4b804bc8187953eb36d2a8c26a02))
- Show the "daily" weather forecast for Singapore:
  - Location (ie. Singapore)
  - Current weather description (ie. sunny)
  - Current temperature
  - Today's high temperature
  - Today's low temperature
- Allow the user to toggle more data in the current conditions' area:
  - Humidity
  - Pressure
  - Sunrise/Sunset Time
- Show the 7-Day forecast as a multi-line chart (use any charting library you would like, but it should be incorporated as a React re-usable component)
  - Y axis should show the High and Low temperature as separate lines
  - X axis should show 7 days (starting with the "current" day)
  - The chart should have a tool tip that when activated shows:
    - Day of the week
    - High temperature
    - Low temperature
    - Weather description (ie. Breezy)
- **Bonus:** Was this too easy? Want to make it a real app? Use the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) with the default location set to Singapore and allow the user to select daily or hourly forecast.
